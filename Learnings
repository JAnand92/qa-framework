Appium:

1. What is hybrid app and web views are?
- There are 3 main types of application:
    a. Native App
    b. IOs Native App
    c. Android Native App
- Mainly build apps are native apps.
- Web views are apps that are written using HTML and access using browser.
- Hybrid app: Looks like native but got Web View as well.

2. To deal with Hybrid application - we need to learn Appium Context Api.

3. Context API: How it works.
- iOS Web view automation: Appium uses "Remote Debugger" protocol to connect to Mobile Safari.
- This protocol helps to get information about the pages, displayed on Safari.
- There is command available to inject java scripts in web pages and appium uses that command to implement all the function
available in web driver api.
- Android Web view automation: There is no issue with it, as there is full implementation available for chrome driver and appium
makes use of it.
